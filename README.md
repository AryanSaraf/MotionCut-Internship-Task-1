# Temperature-Converter
In the first week of my internship with MotionCut I created an interactive CLI application to convert temperature in Celsius to its equivalent in Fahrenheit, and vice versa. It checks the validity of the user's input based on practical temperature limits, matching of input types, and formats and prints the appropriate messages in colour (on the terminals that support it).
